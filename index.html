        <p>
          Parents are always looking for ways to motivate their kids to eat.
          With this app, parents input the servings of food their child eats,
          and the child can watch their gigapet grow and flourish, or wither and
          struggle based on what food they eat. Gigapet is an application that
          helps parents and children practice healthy eating. Available on both
          web and Android, parents can easily sign up from any device and have
          access to everything Gigapet has to offer.

                A balanced diet is key to healthy eating habits because it provides children with the nutrients they need to grow. Such a diet should contain three daily meals and two healthy snacks with foods of the following food groups: protein, carbohydrates, fruits, vegetables, dairy foods, some fat and sugar.
